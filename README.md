# FindMe

*Find hidden objects from a big crowded picture*

The application currently works best on grayscale images and unrotated objects.

![Sample Image](/input/Shake Break.png)

***

### Step 1

Upload the big picture where we need to find the hidden objects

### Step 2

Upload an image that looks similar to the hidden objects

### Step 3

Select a value for the threshold

***

The results may not be very accurate when the hidden objects are of different sizes, colors, backgrounds, and rotations compared to the template image.
This application was deployed to this [webpage](https://share.streamlit.io/jonathanadamrico/findme/main/main.py).
